<h1>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h1>
<h3>OutWiker does not run on Windows. What should I do?</h3>
<br/>
Try to install <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145">MS Visual C++ Redistributable Package</a>. If it does not help, please, send message to the author at <a href="https://jenyay.net/Outwiker/English">OutWiker program page</a> or to e-mail <a href="page://mailto:jenyay.ilin@gmail.com">jenyay.ilin@gmail.com</a> with a full text of error.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Would not it be better, if OutWiker kept notes in one file?</h3>
<br/>
Keeping notes in a tree is the main feature of OutWiker that stands it apart from similar software. It is possible that one day users will be granted choice of how to store their note collections, however, it is not on the developer's to-do list in the near future.<br/>
<h3>Will there be a visual editor for the pages?</h3>
<br/>
Possibility to add such functionality (RichTextFormat seems to be the best candidate to implement wysiwyg editor) is under consideration. But it is still not certain for the moment.<br/>
