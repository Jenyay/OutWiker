Working with attachments is one of the main features of the OutWiker. All files attached to the note are stored in the "__attach" subdirectory of the note's directory. To attach files just copy them into the "__attach" subdirectory. One of the software development tasks was to implement possibility to insert the attached images in note's text.<br/>
<br/>
<i>for example:</i><br/>
<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="__attach/cat.jpg"></div><br/>
<br/>
There is the special button bar (located on the "Attachments" pane) to work with attachments. <br/>
<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="__attach/screenshot.png"></div><br/>
<br/>
Its buttons are as follows:<br/>
<ul>
<li>"Attach Files..." — To attach new files.</li>
<li>"Remove Files..." — To remove selected files.</li>
<li>"Paste" — To insert relative pathname of the selected file into the note's body, e.g., selecting the file "cat.jpg" attached to this note and clicking the "Paste" button results in inserting "__attach/cat.jpg".</li>
<li>"Execute" — To execute the selected file.<br/>
<li>"Open attachments folder" — To open folder with attached files in the default file manager.</li>
</ul>
